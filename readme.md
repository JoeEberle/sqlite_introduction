## Return on Investment (ROI)

The return on investment (ROI) when using SQLite is significant due to its cost-effectiveness, as it is free and comes pre-installed with Python. Its lightweight, serverless design eliminates the need for server maintenance and reduces development time, making it easy to integrate with minimal configuration. This makes SQLite an ideal choice for budget-conscious projects, enabling faster deployment and reliable performance.
